## Introduction

With the rapid development of big data and information technology, surveys have become an indispensable tool for college students in academic research, social surveys, and market research. However, most college students currently face tedious tasks such as manually designing questionnaires, collecting, and analyzing data, leading to low efficiency and poor data quality. To facilitate the learning and work of the college student community and improve survey efficiency and data analysis capabilities, we plan to develop a specialized anonymous online survey system for college students. This system aims to serve the needs of college students while protecting privacy, enabling minority groups to boldly express different needs and opinions.
